            <p class="thin">At the end of 2022, I decided that I wasn't done studying yet, so I enrolled at the IT campus of Thomas More Geel for a graduate course in programming. Right now I'm studying the basics of Csharp, SQL, HTML, and CSS.</p>

            <h1>T E C H :  S C R I P T<hr></h1>
            <p class="thin">I've always been a computer freak, but that passion never really saw the light of day until I started getting more and more interested in the technical side of things during my music studies. During 2020, I started using JavaScript to manipulate MIDI data, which ultimately led me to start integrating more and more scripting and MIDI routing in my live sets or recordings.</p>

            <p class="thin">I'm a keyboard player, songwriter, composer, and sound designer. I've been playing classical piano since I was 5 and started taking it seriously around age 10.</p>
            <p class="thin">In 2023, I finished my music bachelor (pop/rock piano) at PXL Hasselt. During my time at PXL, I learned how to write and compose songs for different genres. I also got interested in audio production and sound design, so I learned how to use Logic Pro X and different types of hardware.</p>
            <p class="thin">Right now, I've been in multiple bands as a keyboard/synth player, wrote songs for both myself and other musicians, produced around 10 records, and mixed/mastered a couple as well. I've also composed for movie trailers, muzak, and art installations.</p>

            <p class="thin">I believe that human interaction is one of the most important factors in doing great in life. I don't think it would be possible to survive without a strong social network in both of my interest branches. That's why I strive to constantly connect with new people and learn from them, or even teach them something!</p>
